Have you ever tried writing on your touchscreen device while on the move, only to end up with illegible scribbles? This common frustration is what the "NoDistort" project aims to eliminate. The project addresses the challenge of handwriting distortion on shaky or moving touchscreens, a problem faced by many in our fast-paced, mobile world.

This was my high school science fair project that won the Gold Medal at the Macronix Science Awards, one of Taiwan's most prestigious science competitions for high school students.

## Why NoDistort may be useful
NoDistort is particularly useful as it significantly improves the usability and accuracy of touchscreen devices in unstable or mobile environments. This technology is beneficial for users who need to write or draw on their devices while in motion, such as in a vehicle or walking. By compensating for movement-related distortions, it ensures legibility and precision in digital handwriting, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Why NoDistort may not be useful
Given the advancements in handwriting recognition algorithms, which are increasingly capable of interpreting and correcting distorted inputs, the utility of NoDistort may be somewhat diminished. These algorithms have evolved to learn from training data, including distorted handwriting, thereby enhancing their accuracy in varied conditions. Additionally, humans inherently possess a level of self-correction when writing in shaky environments. This natural adaptability, combined with the sophistication of current recognition software, suggests that the need for an external solution like NoDistort could be less critical in many situations.

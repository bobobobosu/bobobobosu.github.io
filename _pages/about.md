I am a Robotics Engineer specialized in developing algorithms that enable robots to learn from human demonstration. As a recent Carnegie Mellon University graduate with an M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering, my research focuses on human-robot collaboration, tactile sensing, and multi-robot coordination.

My expertise lies in motion planning and trajectory optimization, with a strong background in implementing perception-planning-control stacks for industrial automation. I've developed systems that can achieve precise manufacturing tasks while adapting to environmental variations and human feedback.

## Research Interests

- **Human-Robot Collaboration**: Creating systems where robots learn from physical human feedback
- **Tactile Sensing**: Developing electronic textile skins for safer robot control
- **Multi-Robot Coordination**: Optimizing workcell layouts and trajectories for industrial applications
- **Motion Planning**: Implementing kinodynamic motion planners for humanoid robots

## Education

- **M.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering**, Carnegie Mellon University (2022-2024)
- **B.S. in Computer Science**, University of California, San Diego (2019-2021)

I'm passionate about creating interactive robots that respond intelligently to human guidance and environmental constraints. Feel free to explore my publications and projects, or reach out to discuss potential collaborations.
